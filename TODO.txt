	1. Add inventory system
		~a. Make a UI for it~
		~b. Item slots with items in it. Minecraft/Terraria inventory style.~
		~c. Find good max stack size. Maybe 999 or 9999?~
			i. Maybe make it a singleton's variable of stack size multiplier. Then 
				on the world_tile.tscn loop through the atlas and change the customdata variable
				to by the Item resource's quantity * stack_size_multiplier
		
		d. Add label so when you hover over an item slot, it gives a bit of information such as name,
			equipment stats, etc. of the item. (If the item slot's res isn't null, ofcourse). 
	
	2. Add crafting system
		a. Using the materials in your inventory, add crafting bench or something
			to use those materials to craft tools.
	
	3. Add building system.
		a. Make placeable on a grid.
		b. Use tilemap.
		
	4. Add storage / chests / stored inventories
		a. Inventories should be saved when you open and close the chest.
		b. You shouldn't be able to break the chest if there are items in it.
		   ^ Just so you dont have a ton of items flying around when it breaks.
 
	5. Add world generation.
		a. Slap together some world gen with tile maps.
		b. Just a basic one with grass, stone, then on top, trees and rocks.
