TODO: 
	Make sure you track time working on project!

	1. Add inventory system
		a. Add left click drag that splits stack evenly and divies up ghost item quantity
			i. Perhaps create a ghost inventory slot / make inventory slot have a change
				visible item function. 
			ii. Reference Minecraft left click + drag splitting. 
				1. Skips over items of different ID.
				2. Adds quantity to items of same ID
				3. Cancels with right click, cancels with sort, cancels with exit inventory. 
					Basically any other inputs cancel the split. 
				4. When you are holding left click and you drag, it previews the split of items. 
				5. Perhaps keep an array of indexes of the slots you drag over and split along
					the inventory/slots at those indexes. 
		
			idea:  Maybe make it a singleton's variable of stack size multiplier. Then 
				on the world_tile.tscn loop through the atlas and change the customdata variable
				to by the Item resource's quantity * stack_size_multiplier
		
		b. Change how block breaking / using items that interact with world works with left and right click. 
			i. Pickaxe will break blocks
			ii. Axe will break trees
			iii. Cannot break blocks directly under a tree
			iv. Etc. 
	
	2. Add test tools for pickaxe and axe.
		a. Pickaxe is for blocks
		b. Axe is for trees
		c. Add hardness to all blocks and resource nodes and a mining speed and level to tools. 
		
	3. If you have a tool or placeable item selected in your hotbar, a small 
		ghost version of it should appear near the bottom right corner of your cursor.
		a. Look at Terraria for reference. 
		
	3. Add storage / chests / stored inventories
		a. Inventories should be saved when you open and close the chest.
		b. You shouldn't be able to break the chest if there are items in it.
		   ^ Just so you dont have a ton of items sflying around when it breaks.
		c. Add unique inventory UIs for the different inventories. 
			i. This should expand upon the InventoryUI scene / inheret from it. 
			ii. Just alter the layout of things.
 
		
	4. Lighting system similar to Terraria lighting. Try using Image.create_from_data 
		and generate an image based on an item's light level. (Check Reddit comment)
	
	5. Create dynamic building check system that checks a given shape based on a
		json file similar to how Minecraft crafting recipies are created. 
		Example could be:
			Tree
			
			size_x = 9
			size_y = 6
			
			# = Tiles.air
			L = Tiles["LEAVES"]
			W = Tiles["LOG"]
			
			#########    This would
			#LLLLLLL#    generate a 
			#LLLLLLL#    tree in this 
			####W####    shape. 
			####W####
			####W####

	6. Add crafting system
		a. Make it something cool like fully customizable tools. Crafting bench takes in items
		into a storage and you can craft things in it. 
		b. Tools will be fully customizable like they are in Tinkers Construct or A Township Tale.
			i. Each tool part has different stats that add together to make a complete tool.
			ii. Tool head sets the tool type. 
			iii. A tool can only be assembled if all parts are there. There will be a blueprint of
					slots like handle, connector, toolhead and different tool types like in old Tinkers Construct 
		
			OLD a. Using the materials in your inventory, add crafting bench or something
				to use those materials to craft tools.
	
	7. Menu with settings for sound, some global variables like difficulty, allow rebinding of input map. 
		a. World generation will have different settings such as stack multiplier and difficulty. 
	
	8. Saving system
		a. Allow players to save their worlds, player data, settings, input map, etc. 
	
	9. Improve World Generation 
		a. Make world generation better. Add biomes. Add lakes, decorations, etc. 
		b. Look into chunking.
		c. Structures.
		d. Add ocean on both sides of map.
		e. Eventually look into adding different dimension / world scenes.
